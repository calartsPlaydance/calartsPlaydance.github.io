  <pre class="d1"> Let's play a game. Let's look back together. On our pasts. On our unique pasts.
    On our unique childhoods. If you are on this page, you have landed right where you
    need to be to play and reflect on your beautiful past through writing, drawing, and
    interacting with short dances. There are seven unique experiences available to you
    that you can play in any order and for the duration you please. Simply follow the
    prompts, and you will be guided to                                 interact with the dancing as you
    see fit. After each experience, you can choose to "play again" to move onto another
    experience or "skip to the end" to do less interacting and more watching. You can
    play for an hour or ten minutes, or come back at another time to play again.
    Let your imagination be vivid and your sense of play be activated as you navigate
    through the site...but most importantly have fun!</pre>
